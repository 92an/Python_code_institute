    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his
    long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when Smaug came and took it.)
    Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company
    because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the
    sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen
    to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Okenshield</h3>
            <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain.
            Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. 
            While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of 
            Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the 
            fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," 
            which would remain with him even in death.

            <h3>Fili &amp; Kili</h3>
            <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís.
             They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór.
              Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.
            </p>
            <p>
            As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. 
            It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.
            With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil.
            They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town.
            The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river.  
            </p>
         
            <p>
            At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and Bilbo.
             Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.
             Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five Armies, 
            and all three were buried with honor.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. 
            He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, 
            and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.
             Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. 
             Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company. 
             He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies,
            and later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin
            </p>
            <p>
            Forty-eight years later, in TA 2989, Óin went to Moria with Balin and Ori, 
            along with many other dwarves, to recover the realm for the Dwarves of Durin's Folk. 
            After Balin became Lord of Moria, according to the Book of Mazarbul, 
            Óin was sent to look for the Upper Armories of the Third Deep, 
            which was apparently westwards of the Hollin Gate (the west gate out of Moria). Some five years passed, 
            with Óin at some point rejoining Balin, before the Moria Orcs attacked. 
            The Dwarves could not escape by the eastern gate because the Orcs held the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, 
            so they tried to escape by the Hollin Gate. But the water outside the door was right up to the wall, 
            and the Watcher in the Water took Óin. He was likely ripped apart and eaten

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after Erebor, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. 
            He was the younger child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin.
            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs,
             though it is unknown what significance he did, being 16 years old.
            In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. 
            In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, 
            pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance with Sauron, when Gandalf mentioned hobbits, 
            Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also said that hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the
             nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. 
            He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. 
            Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated 
            in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, 
            when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
            orn in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, 
            Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. 
            After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, 
            Dwalin accompanied Thrain the Second and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
            </p>
            <p>
            Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, 
            and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin to visit Erebor. 
            The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. 
            In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. 
            After a fruitless search for their leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.
